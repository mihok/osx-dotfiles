This is plugin for automatically restore one file's cursor position and folding information after restart vim.

This is a simple script to autosave cursor position and fold
information using vim\\&#039s mkview.  Although you can easily do this job by
just add serveral line to {.,_}vimrc, write a script plugin can make it
more clean and nice.  We assume you use a new enough vim to enjoy
these feature. Hope you love it:)
                                                                        
Views are only be saved when you save/write a file or EXIT VIM.
     
Suggested Setting:
Please put them in you vimrc:
set viewoptions=cursor,folds,slash,unix
" let g:skipview_files = ['*\.vim']
                                                                   
Set it in a plugin file looks dirty to me.  So you\\&#039d better do it your
self.  This only keywords not in viewoptions is \\\"options\\\". I believe it
does not belong to a view.  If you think you need it, feel free to
put it in.  If you do not want views of some files to be saved, please
set g:loaded_restore_view. The longer time you use, the bigger view
folder you will have.  So if you use UNIX environment, you may need to
use cron to do some clean job.
